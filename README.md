# Hand Cricket Game

This is a simple implementation of the Hand Cricket game in Java. The game allows the user to play a virtual game of Hand Cricket against the computer. The user can either bat or bowl and try to outscore the computer to win the game.

## Rules of the Game

- The game is played using numbers from 1 to 10.

- The user and the computer take turns choosing a number between 1 and 10.

- If the chosen numbers match, the player who is batting is declared "Out."

- The player's score is the sum of the chosen numbers until they get out.

- The player with the highest score at the end of the game wins.

## How to Play

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Open the project in your Java IDE.

3. Run the `Main` class to start the game.

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.

5. Choose a number between 1 and 10 when prompted.

6. Continue playing until you or the computer gets out.

7. The game will display the total score for each player and declare the winner at the end.

Feel free to explore the code and make modifications as needed.
